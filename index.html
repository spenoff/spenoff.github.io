						    <h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
						  	<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						  	<p>My passions include Computer Science, Music, Software Development and Game Programming.</p>
						  	<p>I have been programming for 8 years. Python, TypeScript, C, and Java are my go-to programming languages. Other programming languages I use include C# and JavaScript. As the Vice President of Stony Brook Game Developers, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with other students. I also enjoyed helping students in other roles that I served such as Teaching Assistant (Fundamentals of Software Engineering, Data Structures and Algorithms) and Peer Tutor (Introduction to Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Foundations of Computer Science).</p>
						  	<p>I have been playing the drums for 10 years. When I'm not coding, I play the drum set, tenor drums, timpani, and snare drum. I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/studentaffairs/athletic-bands/index.php"target="_blank">Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band</a> drumline where I play the tenor drums, and a college rock band called Spirit, where I play the drum set and auxiliary percussion.</p>
							<p>I enjoy programming and designing video games in my free time. I learned the Unity game engine by reproducing classic games such as <i>Pong</i> and <i>Space Invaders</i>. In Spring 2019, I won second place in the Stony Brook Game Developers 'Ren-Py' Competition with a game called <a href="https://github.com/spenoff/Blind-Run"target="_blank">Blind Run</a>. In Spring 2020, I was a finalist in the Stony Brook Game Programming Competition with a game called <a href="https://sheer-madness.firebaseapp.com/"target="_blank">Sheer Madness</a>. In Sheer Madness, you play as a dog solving various puzzles to lead sheep into a barn.</p>
							<p>I am currently working on an action game in Unity called <a href="https://simmer.io/@mogao/weapon-a-minute-v1?fbclid=IwAR0oOliETcQtivdFlqO1MzU0Ky-wxf8qUxnxKp1YuLaAnx9FAYJJKePOaoo"target="_blank">Weapon a Minute</a>. In this game, you fight waves of enemies with a weapon that changes every minute. One minute it could be a sword, another it could be a boomerang, and another it could be a banana.</p>

								<p>I am studying Computer Science at Stony Brook because my career goal is to become a software engineer (or a game developer). Some of the courses that I have completed include AP Computer Science, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Foundations of Computer Science (Discrete Mathematics), and Principles of Database Systems.  My coursework has taught me how to apply the content that I have learned into practical programming skills that include an organized and thoughtful approach to software design, coding, testing, and debugging.</p>
								
								<img src="images/SBUDarkRedShieldLogo.png" alt="">
								<p>My interest in Game Development is the root of my career. My ability to create new experiences through Game Development was the reward for learning to program. My passion for game development is represented in my projects as well as my work as Vice President (and former Event Coordinator) of Stony Brook Game Developers.</p>

								<h3><u>Selected Projects</u></h3>

									<p>In this 3D action game developed in Unity, the player has a weapon that changes every minute. One minute it could be a sword, another it could be a boomerang or a banana. Other weapons include a laser gun and a handgun. The goal for the player is to defeat as many enemies as possible before dying.</p></p>

									<p>A visual novel game where the player explores the forest, but has a limited amount of virtual time before the main character becomes blind, forcing the player to navigate the forest based on memory of what they already explored. This was my entry in the the first annual Stony Brook Game Developers Ren-Py Competition.</p></p>

									<p> In this game, the user takes control of a sheepdog to herd sheep into a barn. It was developed in JavaScript using the Phaser game engine. This game was a finalist in the 2020 Stony Brook University Game Programming Competition. In addition to my involvement in programming this game, I also created the level music and sound effects.</p></p>

								<h2>Hackathons</h2>
								<div style="clear: left;">
									<p style="float: left;"><img src="images/talk_the_walk.png" alt=""></a>  </p><p>  </p>
									<p>I love hackathons. They are strong opportunities to learn more and develop new skills related to Computer Science outside of classes, as well as share skills with others. In my Sophomore year, I led a Web Development Workshop for Hack Health. In my Junior year, I participated in Penn-Apps and built an application using Twilio called “Talk the Walk.” This tool was an automated speaker that could be called on your cell phone when one is walking home at night, as a way to appear as though they are not alone. Next semester, I plan to participate in Hack at CeWIT.</p>

								<h2>Internships</h2>
								<div style="clear: left;">
									<p style="float: left;"><img src="images/nrl.png" alt=""></a>  </p><p>  </p>
									<p>I served as an Administrative Intern and a Software Engineer Intern for Emerson Public School as well as a Research Intern for the Office of Naval Research, Naval Research Laboratory. These internships develop my ability to work on long term projects and develop my teamwork skills. I am thankful for these opportunities to develop my skills.</p>

						<!-- Music -->
							<article id="music">
								<h2 class="major">Music</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I currently play drum set for a Rock Band called Spirit as well as the Stony Brook Pep Band. I also play tenor drums for the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/studentaffairs/athletic-bands/index.php"target="_blank">Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band.</a></p>
								<p>My grandfather bought me my first drum set when I was nine years old. That drum set changed my life in many ways. Having been involved in music groups throughout my life, I have developed many skills such as teamwork, companionship, and leadership.</p>
								
								<h2>Marching Band</h2>
								<div style="clear: left;">
									<p style="float: left;"><img src="images/marchingband.png" alt=""></a>  </p><p>  </p>
									<p>Marching Band is an activity that I have been involved with since High School and will continue until I graduate from Stony Brook University. In my last two years of High School, I served as Section Leader of the Drumline, where I developed my leadership skills. The Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band has introduced me to a group with a variety of backgrounds as well as talented musicians that I am thankful to have learned from. I can also be found playing the drum set for Stony Brook Basketball games during Basketball season.</p>
								</div>
								
								<h2>Rock Band</h2>
								<div style="clear: left;">
									<p style="float: left;"><img src="images/spirit.png" alt=""></a>  </p><p>  </p>
									<p>I am part of a student run Rock Band called “Spirit.” When it comes to rock music, my primary instrument is the drum set, but I also will often play auxiliary percussion, such as cowbell or tambourine. Before Covid-19, Spirit would perform for events around the Stony Brook University such as Roth Regatta.</p>

					  <!-- Why Me -->
								<article id="whyme">
									<h2 class="major">Why Me?</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Besides my programming skills, I have many qualities that would make me an exceptional asset to any organization or team.  First and foremost is my ability to focus on tasks, problems or projects. I have an extremely strong work ethic and know how to prioritize my time to focus on the project at hand. I am a quick study and love to learn new techniques, languages, and approaches to programming.  Lastly, overcoming adversity is a skill I learned early on in life.  Those struggles have served me well in the world of programming.</p>
