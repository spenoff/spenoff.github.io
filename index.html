						  	<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						  	<p>My passions include Computer Science, Music, Software Development and Game Programming.</p>
						  	<p>I have been programming for 8 years. C, TypeScript, Python, Java are my go-to programming languages. Other programming languages I use include C#, and JavaScript. As the Event Coordinator of Stony Brook Game Developers, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with other students.</p>
						  	<p>I have been playing the drums for 10 years. When I'm not coding, I play the drum set, tenor drums, timpani, and snare drum. I'm a member of the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/studentaffairs/athletic-bands/index.php"target="_blank">Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band</a> drumline and a college rock band called Spirit.</p>
						  	<p>I enjoy programming and designing video games in my free time. In my free time, I like to reproduce classic games such as <i>Pong</i> and <i>Space Invaders</i> in a game engine called Unity. Last Spring, I won second place in the Stony Brook Game Developers 'Ren-Py' Competition with a game called <a href="https://github.com/spenoff/Blind-Run"target="_blank">Blind Run</a>.</p>

								<p>I am studying Computer Science at Stony Brook because my career goal is to become a software engineer. Some of the courses that I have completed include AP Computer Science, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Foundations of Computer Science (Discrete Mathematics), and Principles of Database Systems.  My coursework has taught me how to apply the content that I have learned into practical programming skills that include an organized and thoughtful approach to software design, coding, testing, and debugging.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Music</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I currently play drum set for a Rock Band called Spirit as well as the Stony Brook Pep Band. I also play tenor drums for the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/studentaffairs/athletic-bands/index.php"target="_blank">Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band.</a></p>
								<p>My grandfather bought me my first drum set when I was nine years old. That drum set changed my life in many ways. Having been involved in music groups throughout my life, I have developed many skills such as teamwork, companionship, and leadership.</p>

								<article id="whyme">
									<h2 class="major">Why Me?</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Besides my programming skills, I have many qualities that would make me an exceptional asset to any organization or team.  First and foremost is my ability to focus on tasks, problems or projects. I have an extremely strong work ethic and know how to prioritize my time to focus on the project at hand. I am a quick study and love to learn new techniques, languages, and approaches to programming.  Lastly, overcoming adversity is a skill I learned early on in life.  Those struggles have served me well in the world of programming.</p>
